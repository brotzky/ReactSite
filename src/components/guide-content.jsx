      <p>Front End developers have it rough. One day they're expected to know Technology A and then the next day they have to know Technology B. There have been times where I was in the middle of learning Technology A and then I read and started to notice that the community now prefers Technology B. So, what's the deal? How does a developer prepare for an interview in a field that moves so quickly? <br/>By focusing on the fundamentals first.</p>

      <h2>What this prepartion will & will not cover</h2>
      <p>Front End development has endless tools, frameworks, and libraries that neatly tie into everyday development, but this interview preperation resource will not cover any of them. Furthermore, there will also be no talk of algorithms and data structures. Why? Firstly, I believe the the majority of Front End development can boil down to 3 core pieces: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Those are the universal building blocks that majority of the Front End revolves around. Without a solid understanding of those pieces it would impossible to progress into the tools built on top of them.</p>

      <h2>What's expected of a Front End Developer?</h2>
      <p>This may be the hardest question to answer as everyone has a slightly different expectation when it comes to hiring a Front End developer. I don't think I've seen two seperate companies expecting the same thing out of a Front End Developer. I've seen job posts looking for Front End Engineers that expect solid Software Engineering fundamentals with a heavy emphasis on JavaScript logic. I've also seen Front End developer job posts that are listed as Front End developer/designer that expect strong design skills focused on UI with expert CSS and HTML. Then there are posts that expect Front End developers to be able help on the Back End when needed and a keen eye for design. </p>
      <p>The expectation is so varied that it makes interviewing and finding the perfect position difficult. This puts stress on both the company and developer since each party may have vastly different expecations of what a Front End developer should do.</p>
