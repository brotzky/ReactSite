React based Website
====

I am creating a Front End Developer focused website that will contain materials for anyone wanting to learn, improve, or hire a Front End Developer. 

###Brief###

I am using React in *(what I think is)* a non-traditional sense. This is mostly a static website with only one data source that is fetched on first load. I am using React Router with Reflux for routing and data gathering. The main objective of this project is to experiment with React's capabilities and learn the tools and development process around it while providing readers with an excellent Front End source.

###Getting Started###

Checkout this repo, install depdencies, then start the gulp process with the following:

```
	> git clone https://github.com/brotzky/ReactSite.git ReactSite
	> cd ReactSite
	> npm install
	> gulp
```


###Content###
There will be 3-4 sections

1. Introduction
2. Learning Resources
3. Practice Resources
4. For Hiring Managers


####Future####
- Port over ES5 code to ES6
- Incorporate Redux instead of Reflux
